# bankaccount-kata

### What are we talking about?

The original kata proposal can be found [here on kata-log](https://kata-log.rocks/banking-kata).

### The design intent

I've helped engineer software for a banking company before.

I tried to comply with both KISS & YAGNI clean code principles.

In the meantime, I've tried to flex my memory muscles a bit and implement a less naive domain than required.

===

In a nutshell, my aim was to give a sense of reality to this kata and set decent foundations capable of evolving with modern banking business rules and standards.
